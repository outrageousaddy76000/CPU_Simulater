# CPU_Simulater

Welcome to the CPU Simulator Project! This project uses a priority queue to simulate a CPU. The user can input initial processes and a time slice for the CPU. The running time of all tasks is then displayed on the screen. The user can also dynamically input new tasks using a prompt in the program. The task is then added to the queue and the runtime is output when the task is completed by the CPU simulator. The program ends after displaying the runtime of the last task when all tasks are completed.

Installation

Before you can run this project, you'll need to install C. Here's how:

Install C

Go to the C website and follow the instructions to install C for your specific operating system.
Running the Project

Once you have C installed, you're ready to run the project. Follow these steps:

Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g. Eclipse, Visual Studio).
Run the main.c file.
The program will prompt you to enter the initial processes and time slice for the CPU. Follow the prompts to enter this information.
The program will simulate the CPU and display the running time of each task as it is completed.
The program will prompt you to enter new tasks if desired. Follow the prompts to enter new tasks or input "no" to continue without adding any new tasks.
The program will continue to simulate the CPU until all tasks are completed. The runtime of the last task will be displayed and the program will exit.

Additional Notes

The priority of each task is determined by its relative importance or urgency. Higher priority tasks are completed before lower priority tasks.
The time slice is the amount of time that the CPU allocates to each task before switching to the next task.
Make sure to follow the prompts carefully when entering information for the initial processes and new tasks.
I hope you enjoy using this project! If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out.
